# Simple Payment System


### This project was born with the objective to have a dummy implementation of payment but, I have changed my mind a little bit

The deal before was only to have a dummy implementation but thinking and then coding it, I have found a few opportunities of study and then im moving it to build another thing.
I'll make a frankstain platform, which have different features so, I can keep practicing along the way without worrying about high scaling anything or be the best solution possible

Frankstain pieces:

Stackoverflow analytics features/objectives:
!I have found a few stackoverflow data public distributed in the internet that would give me a few things to play
- GraphQL api to read about posts & user and etc...
- simple dashboard to show some analytics about users X posts across the time
-- Stack: Python+Golang for GraphQL APIS[same implementation != languages]


Marketplace features/objectives:
- Login/Logout + oauth
- Product list
- Cart 
- Payment
-- Stack: Python + FastAPI, svelte on frontend
